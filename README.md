# Encoder-Example
Example code to use a rotary encoder to send signals to a switch

This is the code I used on my YouTube channel to rebuild a 1976 Sony Trinitron TV. The code watches for encoder activity and then activates a switch on the push button interface. You should use transistors on the push buttons for the best reliability.
